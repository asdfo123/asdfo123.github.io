# 👋 About Me <img src="images/decorates/maple.png" style="height:30px; vertical-align:bottom;">

Hi! I am an incoming PhD student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk). I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn), Weihai, where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Dianbo Sui](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/suidianbo?lang=en). Previously, I was a research assistant and visiting research student at [HKUST(GZ)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn), and a research assistant at [HKU CDS](https://cds.hku.hk).
 
My research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on Model Editing (Knowledge Editing, KE), Knowledge, Reasoning, and Efficient ML. More recently, I have become interested in Diffusion models and Video Generation.

Previously, I was a competitive programming (CP) contestant and a leader of the ACM club, working under the guidance of [Prof. Kaikun Dong](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/dongkaikun?lang=en).

<span style="color:red">I am actively seeking Research Intern opportunities.</span>
